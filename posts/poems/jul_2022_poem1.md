## Siesta
Siphon the will, instill\
The lustre of tight flesh\
Beaming red, glaring gold\
Leach from me the days and days\
Each a column of a bleach white masoleum\
To a fig syrup and honey fingered god\
To whom shadow is a blaspheme\
But to a hot-blooded girl is charity\
And a fine place to lay\
To await cooler winds
