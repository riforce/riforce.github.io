## Windowsill Basil
My verdant stained fingernails\
Cutting, pinching\
Filling hands with the scent of a\
Terra cotta morning\
Hot clay and pungent earth\
Filling ancient hands with a time when\
Women carried squash blossoms in the\
Sheaves of their salt-stiff skirts\
And Crushed tomatoes with their heels\
Cutting, pinching\
Leaves from their windowsill stems\
With verdant stained fingernails
