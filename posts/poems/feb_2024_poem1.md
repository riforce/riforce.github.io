## Grown Up Talk
Please hold me like I'm small and ask me:\
"Are you okay?"\
So I can say "No,\
I burned my tongue\
And I've forgotten how to talk to trees."\
And please don't say that's silly--\
Please believe me that I could once,\
When I was seven,\
And even when I was fifteen\
and ashamed to listen to them out loud.\
Let me go to a quiet place\
Where I can remember who I was\
Before I was this\
Civilized creature that you love.\
Would you still love me then,\
If I remembered how to talk to trees?\
Would you still love me\
Even if the worst is true\
If I can't?
