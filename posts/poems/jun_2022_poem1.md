## Girl Gone
She will pick you up\
And keep you in her pocket,\
If only for a few miles\
Like a piece of sea glass\
Or a knucklebone\
But the seasons turn over\
Like a lover's cold pillow\
And all that will be left of her is\
Her shape in the grass, in wrinkled sheets\
And you'd like to think\
That you'd been the first to say goodbye\
But she was a wild thing gone\
Long before she loved you\
Just as the hands that brush the wind\
Cannot hold it\
She was never yours to let go\
And you, only hers to find.
