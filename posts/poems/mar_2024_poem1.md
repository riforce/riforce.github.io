## The Raven Queen of Tal'Umbag
I walked to the edge\
Of stone and snow\
And left my treasure at the floor\
Of the Raven Queen\
And her nest of bones\
In the tomb of Sil'Gabor\
\
She cocked her head\
And clacked her beak\
At the pity of my naked skin\
And said to me\
With a voice that creaked:\
"You are a beast of flesh and sin,\
\
"But the sea and sky\
Care not of fault\
Nor of your many follies vain\
But rather if\
You weather with\
The wash of wind and thunder-rain."\

She asked of me\
To shed the weight\
Of what I thought and ought and should\
And what was left:\
A thirst to sate\
With the water-wine of Quai-Pagud\
\
It did not quench\
My aching throat\
Though be it slickening and sweet\
But from my flesh\
Did plumage sprout\
And talons curled from human feet\
\
"Now may you fledge\
From cliff on high\
And master cloud and torrent cool\
But you your woes\
Must leave behind\
Lest you fall from fear and die a fool."\
\
And so I went\
With wings abroad\
Into the crimson stars of Lorm\
And never more\
A moment spent\
Submitting to a falser form.\
