## September, Again
If you had told me then\
That I would be so adored,\
So completely understood,\
So precious to one\
With sunspot eyes of lakeshore blue,\
And hands warm as a summer evening spent\
Watching the hills go\
From white to green to gold,\
I would have told you to wake me up\
And plunge me back into the dark I'd\
grown to call strength and independence.\
If you had told me I would love him,\
That I would really love him,\
And that his smile would light a match in my chest,\
And that his voice would be an anchor,\
I would have run.\
How fortunate then, that I had not known,\
That no one could have warned me.\
How lucky I was that love,\
So whole and arresting,\
Is slow and soft and stealthy;\
For I am firmly in its tender teeth\
And quite content to be eaten whole.
