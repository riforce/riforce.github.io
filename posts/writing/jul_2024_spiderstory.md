I found a spider in my room. Small and brown, climbing the wall over my bed. I trapped her in a jar and fretted over sliding the paper under her. What if she fell out onto my hand? What if I pinched one of her legs between the jar and the page? What was this life I was holding, and why did it feel small enough to weigh against my own fear of touching it?\

I let her out in the driveway by the wild poppies growing through the gravel. She did not run from me. I wished she would, so I could take my paper and my jar and go back to my room. But I waited and let her hold me captive as I had held her. And when she left, I bid her good night. Aloud, in a small voice fit for speaking to spiders. Or for speaking to the stranger getting off the train at your stop, who'd shown you a photo of their granddaughter.\

I wonder if she understood.
