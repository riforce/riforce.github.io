Visited Jaiden in Fort Collins and had such a great silly time. Wish I could remember the magic trick we learned in the burger joint during the flood \(maybe that's what made it magic\). Wish I'd spent less time preoccupied with whoever I thought I was. Best macarons I've ever made, best guava jam I've ever had. I promise I tried to have the watch fixed, but they couldn't find the parts. I think it was meant to stay that way.
